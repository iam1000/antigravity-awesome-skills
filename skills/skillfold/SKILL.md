# Skillfold

## Overview

Skillfold is a configuration language and compiler for multi-agent AI pipelines. You define atomic skills, compose them into agents, wire agents into typed execution graphs, and compile the result to platform-native formats for Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Codex, Goose, Roo Code, Kiro, Junie, and Agent Teams.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when setting up a multi-agent pipeline that needs to run across different AI coding tools
- Use when composing reusable skill fragments into specialized agents
- Use when you need typed state validation across agent handoffs
- Use when you want a single YAML config that compiles to any supported platform

## How It Works

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npm install skillfold
```

### Step 2: Initialize a Pipeline

Scaffold a new pipeline from a built-in template:

```bash
npx skillfold init my-team --template dev-team
```

Available templates: `dev-team`, `content-pipeline`, `code-review-bot`.

This creates a `skillfold.yaml` config with atomic skills, composed agents, typed state, and a team flow.

### Step 3: Compile to a Target Platform

Compile the pipeline into platform-native output:

```bash
# Claude Code agents and skills
npx skillfold --target claude-code

# Cursor rules
npx skillfold --target cursor

# GitHub Copilot instructions
npx skillfold --target copilot

# Gemini agents and skills
npx skillfold --target gemini

# OpenAI Codex AGENTS.md
npx skillfold --target codex

# All 12 targets are supported
```

### Step 4: Validate the Config

Check that the config is well-formed, all skill references resolve, state types are valid, and the execution graph has no cycles or unreachable nodes:

```bash
npx skillfold validate
```

### Step 5: Inspect the Pipeline

List all skills, state fields, and team flow nodes:

```bash
npx skillfold list
```

Generate an interactive graph visualization:

```bash
npx skillfold graph --html > pipeline.html
```

### Step 6: Run the Pipeline (Optional)

Execute the pipeline end-to-end with an agent spawner:

```bash
npx skillfold run --target claude-code
```

> **Prerequisite:** `skillfold run` requires the [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`) to be installed and authenticated. The default `cli` spawner invokes `claude` directly; the alternate `sdk` spawner requires the optional `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` peer dependency.

Supports dry-run mode (`--dry-run`), checkpoint-based resume (`--resume`), conditional routing, loops with iteration guards, and parallel map execution.

## Config Structure

A `skillfold.yaml` has four top-level sections:

```yaml
skills:
  atomic:
    planning: ./skills/planning
    coding: ./skills/coding
  composed:
    engineer:
      compose: [planning, coding]
      description: "Plans and implements code changes"

state:
  task:
    type: string

team:
  flow:
    - engineer:
        reads: [state.task]
        writes: [state.task]
      then: end
```

## Key Features

- **Skill composition**: Atomic skills are reusable fragments. Composed skills concatenate them in order. Composition is recursive.
- **Typed state**: Schema with primitives, lists, custom types, and external resource locations. Reads and writes are validated at compile time.
- **Execution graphs**: Directed flows with conditional routing (`when` clauses), loops with exit conditions, and parallel `map` over list state.
- **12 compilation targets**: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Gemini, Codex, Goose, Roo Code, Kiro, Junie, Agent Teams, and the default SKILL.md format.
- **Pipeline runner**: `skillfold run` spawns agents, manages state, handles conditionals and loops, and supports checkpoint-based resume.
- **Shared library**: 11 built-in atomic skills (planning, research, code-writing, testing, etc.) importable into any config.

## Best Practices

- Keep atomic skills small and focused on a single capability
- Use `skillfold validate` before compiling to catch config errors early
- Use `skillfold --check` in CI to verify compiled output stays current
- Pin remote skill imports to a specific tag or commit SHA with `@ref`
- Use `skillfold watch` during development for auto-recompile on changes

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Compiled output is out of date after editing `skillfold.yaml`
  **Solution:** Run `npx skillfold --target <target>` again, or use `skillfold watch` for auto-recompile.

- **Problem:** Circular skill composition causes infinite recursion
  **Solution:** The compiler detects cycles and reports them. Restructure the composition to break the cycle.

- **Problem:** State write conflicts between agents in the flow
  **Solution:** The graph validator flags conflicting writes. Assign exclusive write ownership to each state field.
